<p>We braved reports of impending bad weather Thursday night to head out to West Seattle to check out the opening at TWaC. The founders have waited four long years before they shows their work together. Having only seen Mary's work, I was pretty excited to see what the other two had to offer.  The show was great. And not just because of the cupcake (I swear, the cupcakes are not the <em>only</em>&nbsp;reason I head out to TWaC openings). The space was rocking a &nbsp;decent crowd and lots of people actually showed up in Tacky Christmas Sweaters as the party suggested was appropriate.  Some of my favorite pieces were the WTF peeps and the one with the Batman and Robin reference. Very funny stuff, Erin!  All in all, a great mix of artwork. It was interesting to see it all on display together. I am hoping to see more of their work out and about!
