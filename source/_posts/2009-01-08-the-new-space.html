<br /><b>Our New Home</b><br />
<p>The new <a href="http://suite100gallery.com/">Suite 100 Gallery</a> space at 2316 2nd Ave is starting to feel like home. Since we <a href="http://suite100gallery.com/article/2008/12/27/suite-100-gallery-relocates">announced that we were relocating</a>, time has flown by far too quickly. Our new showÂ <em><a href="http://suite100gallery.com/show/2009/01/09/local-aesthetic">Local Aesthetic</a></em> opens in less than 24 hours and there is plenty left to do!</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to posting a bunch of photos from the openings sometime this weekend. Yes, you read that right. Openings. We are planning on having both spaces open for the 2nd Fridays <a href="http://belltownartwalk.com/">Belltown Art Walk</a>. As if one space was not already enough to keep our small Suite 100 Gallery team busy!</p>
<p>Make sure to come check out the show. It is going to be quite great. <a href="http://suite100gallery.com/artist/troygua">Troy's</a>, <a href="http://suite100gallery.com/artist/ryanmolenkamp">Ryan's</a> and <a href="http://suite100gallery.com/artist/gregboudreau">Greg's</a> work all look amazing. It is so going to be worth seeing it in person!</p>
