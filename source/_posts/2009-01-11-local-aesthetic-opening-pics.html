<p>Pics for the opening of <a href="http://suite100gallery.com/">Suite 100 Gallery's</a> <em><a href="http://suite100gallery.com/show/2009/01/09/local-aesthetic">Local Aesthetic</a></em>&nbsp;show have been uploaded. Make sure to check out all of the pics on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/suite100gallery/">Suite 100 Gallery's flickr</a>!</p>
<p>Overall, the night went very well! All three artists were onhand to chat it up with the patrons as they wandered around Suite 100 Gallery's new larger space.</p>

<p>Seizing the unique opportunity afforded by having access to two spaces, the Suite 100 Gallery team decided to show from both the new and old location for the first half of the <a href="http://belltownartwalk.com/">Belltown Art Walk</a>. The crowd at the old location dwindled down around 8:00 and we closed the doors for the last time on the old space.</p>
<p>These works are definitely a must see in person as they simply cannot be represeneted well digitally. Suite 100 Gallery is open between noon and six during the week and can arrange for weekend and evening showings upon request. Don't miss this opportunity to check out these works!</p>
