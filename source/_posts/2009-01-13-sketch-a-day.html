<p>I need to get back into a sketch-a-day program. It never ceases to amaze me just how easy it is to fall out of a good habit. If only it were as easy to fall out of <em>bad</em>&nbsp;habits, you know?</p>
<p>I think this time around I am not going to try and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kirkryyn/tags/ladyaday/">post something every day</a>, just make sure I actually try to sketch something. Although I was pretty good about it, I think it still put too much pressure on me to make sure that I was doing "good work" when really what should matter at this point is that I do work at all.</p>
<p>This is sort of a balance issue, as well. For as good as I would like to think my multitasking skills are, it is often the case that I end up putting all of my focus into one area of my life. Just from the short time I have been blogging this has become pretty clear. Art was a huge focus for a month or so, and since then it has fallen way behind to the software side of things.</p>
<p>One of my assumptions about having a blog seems to be somewhat accurate. It does seem to provide a pretty good picture about which aspects of my life are higher on the totem pole at any given period. I am excited to see how this pans out over time.</p>
