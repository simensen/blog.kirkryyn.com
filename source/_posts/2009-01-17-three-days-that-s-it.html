<p>Well, I made it three days on my <a href="http://not-invented-here.com/2009/01/13/sketch-a-day/">Sketch A Day</a> plan. Yes, just three days! That's it. Lame.</p>

<p>Then again, all of the rest I managed to get last night was long overdue. I went down for a quick "nap" at 7:00pm and didn't wake up until just after midnight. Fell asleep again by 1:00am and didn't wake again until 9:30am.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am not sure if I'll get around to any sketching tonight, either. I am going to go see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1013753/">Milk</a> with Bec and some other peeps. Should be fun, but movie nights do not lend themselves to Getting Things Done (Sketching or otherwise).</p>
