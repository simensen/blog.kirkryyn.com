<p>Nine days passed since my last blog post. Funny how things seem to go that way. Many things are going to change this year. Most of them are probably for the best. Could have done without receiving that audit notice, though. Hurray! :)</p>

<p>No sketching.</p>

<p>No side software projects.</p>

<p>No s3a.</p>

<p>No DJing.</p>

<p>Barely any Kung Fu.</p>

<p>I think that things will start to smooth out once February hits. At least that is my hope.</p>
