I've found myself completely drowning in fires this year. So much has changed. Moving, relaunching and incorporating the gallery. s3a.  Leaving Halogen Creative and forming Dragonfly Development. Finding out I have been selected for an audit.

Things are rocky, but least my income is secure, right?

Early last week I finally got around to subscribing to Cisco Google News alerts in the hopes that I could stay better in the loop on what is going on with Cisco as the economy continues to be iffy. Barely two days after I set it up, news reports about Cisco cutting as many as 1,500 to 2,500 employees started to trickle in. Such wonderful timing.

I get the feeling that late 2008 and early 2009 have actually been pretty crazy for many people. Everything is in flux. This is probably a good thing, but wow. It sure can be stressful...
