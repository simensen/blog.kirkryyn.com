I love it when I come to realize that software <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern">patterns</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">anti-patterns</a> apply to things outside of software. Some more so than others. <a href="http://not-invented-here.com/2008/11/18/reinventing-the-golden-wheel/">Not Invented Here</a> is an anti-pattern that has quite clearly had an impact on my life. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">Analysis paralysis</a> is another anti-pattern that I often find entering my life more often than I would really like.

Several projects are currently suffering from the effects of prolonged analysis paralysis. I started to realize this yesterday, and I believe that is usually the first step towards addressing the problem and moving forward. Baby steps.
