Pretty much every night this week I had hoped to start doing some major work on putting together the new <a href="http://halogengallery.com/">Halogen</a> website. Pretty much every night something has gotten in the way of making that goal happen. In some cases, it was <a href="http://not-invented-here.com/2009/03/03/analysis-paralysis/">purely my own fault</a>. In other cases it had to do with either <a href="http://belltownmartialarts.com/">Kung Fu</a> or fun outings to <a href="http://www.machiavellis.com/">Capitol Hill</a>.

As I sit here tonight, realizing I have still not yet written one line of code or HTMLM for the Halogen website, I cannot help but wonder if I'm ever going to get to it? Sure, I got plenty of things done tonight. I am almost always busy with <em>something</em>. I am so grateful that I have been having so much help with the gallery stuff these days.

I saw some recent traffic on the Outlet ORM mailing list again and realized I haven't talked to Alvaro in over a month and haven't touched Respose in almost as long. All in good time, I suppose.

Even this post could be considered more procrastination if I wasn't also feeling a little down about still not finding the time to put at least one thing down here at least every other day. I really do have a lot to write about. Just not enough time...
