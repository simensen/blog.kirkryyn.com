Paradon, one of our local <a href="http://www.realchangenews.org/">Real Change</a> vendors, has been working on his "50 ways to help another" project for awhile now, and has asked me if I would help contribute to his next book release. My "homework" was to write a paragraph on his "things to do" list. Of everything on the list of available topics, "finish a project" jumped out at me. Especially given my recent reflections on analysis paralysis, it seemed very appropriate.

When confronted with a bad bout of analysis paralysis, one thing that can help get things moving again is to pick some smaller aspect of a project and finish it. Even if it is not the most important thing on the list, it accomplishes a couple of important things. First, you've finished something! Your TODO list has gotten at least one item shorter. Second, doing so might give you insight into the project that will help you make other decisions you've been stuck pondering.

The key thing is that <em>doing something</em> is very important. Even if it seems minor and unimportant when looking at the larger list of things to do, doing something is almost always preferable to doing nothing and just thinking about getting things done.

For me, this was accomplished by my recent work on Halo and Skittle with themed templates. It is relatively minor compared to the bulk of the other projects I am planning on doing, but having that worked out means I do not have to worry about <em>if</em> themed templates are going to be possible, I can just count them in as being available and can worry about the countless other issues to figure out.
