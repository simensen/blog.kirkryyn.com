<p>It has been a full month since my last post. Of the many things that have happened since then, the largest, by far, is that I asked my girlfriend to marry me. She said yes.</p>

<p>:)</p>

<p>Also, I fell and hurt my knee. Sucks. Kung fu? Not so much. Stitches out on Monday and am hoping to be back at it quickly. After my month and a half break earlier this year</p>

<p>We have had some really excellent artwork at <a href="http://halogengallery.com/">Halogen</a> the last few months. <a href="http://suite100gallery.com/show/2009/05/08/kendra-binney-rudy-fig-and-jeremiah-ketner">Our current show</a> is pretty amazing.</p>

<p>Did some research on some cloud computing services. Now running a <a href="http://mosso.com/">Mosso</a> <a href="http://www.mosso.com/cloudservers.jsp">Cloud Server</a> after having considered a fully dedicated system and comparing EC2, Mosso Cloud Servers and Go Grid.</p>

<p>I've started tinkering with a new open source project, Safsi. More on that soon.</p>

<p>Did I mention I'm getting married? :)</p>
