<p>My wife and I watched the 4th of July fireworks together tonight. My wife. It is going to take some time getting used to that but it is already starting to feel pretty natural!</p>

<p>So much has happened this year! Let me see.... engaged, married, almost every member of my family has now been to Seattle, my family has grown considerably, friends had their baby, I started two businesses, survived an audit, I went camping (in my own tent!), started several open source projects (now to finish them!), started a few closed source projects, learned a new programming language... I know I'm missing a few big things and tons of little ones, but wow! Just these things? And it is only July? Wow.</p>

<p>I've given up on the idea that things are going to settle down quickly. Time to just run with it.</p>
