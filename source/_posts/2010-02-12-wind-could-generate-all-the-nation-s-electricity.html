				<div class="snap_preview"><p>Almost two years ago, the Department of Energy laid out an ambitious goal for the nation: generate 20 percent of electric power from wind by 2030.</p>
<p>Turns out that is just a drop in the bucket. The United States has the potential to generate more than 30 times as much energy from the wind, according to a study released Thursday.</p>
<p>The study looks at the 48 continental states and find the country has enough wind blowing onto it shores and across its plains to generate 10.5 million MW of electricity. That is substantially more than the 1.5 MW of generation it is expected to need by 2030.</p></div></div></blockquote>

    <p>Why can't we make this happen?</p></div>
